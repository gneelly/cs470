• Experiences and Strengths: Explain how this course will help you in reaching your professional goals.

o What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
▪ This course helped with developing a cloud platform like AWS. How to integrate multiple cloud-development features like AWS Lambda and S3.

o Describe your strengths as a software developer.
▪ My strengths are in troubleshooting issues that I find along the way, or stepping back and breaking down the aspects 
of the problem to determine where the issue is.

o Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.
▪ I am ready for development, QA and troubleshooting.

• Planning for Growth: Synthesize the knowledge you have gathered about cloud services.
o Identify various ways that microservices or serverless may be used to produce efficiencies of management and scale in your 
web application in the future. Consider the following:

▪ How would you handle scale and error handling?
• Scale with serverless architecture can be handled with scalable database like DynamoDB and services like AWS Lambda.

▪ How would you predict the cost?
• The cost for these things must take into account the projected use of the services, as they are pay-per-use, 
it matters how big the traffic will be.

▪ What is more cost predictable, containers or serverless?

o Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.
▪ Plans for expansion depend on a couple of factors, the ability to migrate to a cloud structure. With the ability to migrate you 
can have several iterations of the service running so it will stay up, as well cloud services can be more modular in their growth. 
You lose flexibility in many aspects such as data, in large databases you don’t want to have everything process when called, it needs 
to be set up before the call or else it will lag.

o What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?
▪ Elasticity is important for not wasting resources on something when it is not being used, this is great for large scale businesses 
to save money. Pay-for-service is also great as it is much like the previous point, only when the service is used does the company have to pay.
